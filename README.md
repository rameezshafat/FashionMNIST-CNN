# CNN Model Development in PyTorch Tutorial

### Overview
This tutorial notebook provides a step-by-step guide to developing, training, and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch. We use the FashionMNIST dataset to build a CNN capable of classifying various clothing items. This notebook is ideal for those looking to deepen their understanding of CNNs and PyTorch essentials, including data loading, model building, and training processes.

### Contents
1. **Importing Libraries** – Import necessary libraries (e.g., `torch`, `torchvision`, `matplotlib`).
2. **Data Loading and Transformation** – Load the FashionMNIST dataset and transform images into tensors.
3. **Data Visualization** – Display sample images with labels.
4. **Creating DataLoaders** – Prepare data for batch processing.
5. **Building the CNN Model** – Define a custom CNN model with multiple layers for feature extraction and classification.
6. **Defining the Loss Function and Optimizer** – Set up `CrossEntropyLoss` and `SGD` optimizer.
7. **Training and Testing Functions** – Implement functions for training and evaluating the model.
8. **Making Predictions and Evaluating** – Use softmax to make predictions, and visualize performance with a confusion matrix.
9. **Saving and Loading the Model** – Save and reload model weights for later use.

### Requirements
To run this notebook, you'll need the following packages installed:

- Python 3.8+
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (version 1.10.0+ recommended)
- `torchvision` (version 0.11.0+ recommended)
- `matplotlib`
- `torchmetrics` (for the confusion matrix, optional)
- `mlxtend` (for confusion matrix plotting, optional)

You can install these packages using:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib torchmetrics mlxtend
```

### Usage
1. **Clone the Repository** (if in a repo) or download the notebook file.
2. **Install Dependencies** as described in the requirements section.
3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the notebook with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Follow the code cells sequentially to understand each step.
   - Modify and experiment with parameters, such as `BATCH_SIZE`, learning rate, and model architecture, to see their effects on model performance.
